\section*{Requirements Specification}

	\subsection*{External Interface and Architectural Requirements}
		
		The NavUp system will be available for use on many platforms and make use of multiple means of newtork links and other extenal interfaces such as GPS and GIS services.
		Other requirements such as quality, integration and architectural constraints will also be covered in this section.
		
			\subsubsection*{Access Channel Requirements}
				From the typical user's perspective, us as humans, the NavUp system will largely be focused on mobile devices such as Android or iOS smartphones.
				These devices, will make use of location services and internet capabilities to send and recieve data to and from access channels and servers using mobile data,
				WiFi signals, crowdsourcing and geolocation systems such as GPS and GIS. The campus WiFi network will be the main form of system access as the signal
				strength covers most of the large area the University spans, and will help location accuracy indoors where the mobile devices may struggle to find decent mobile
				and location based signals.
				
			\subsubsection*{Quality Requirements}
				A system of the complexity and scale of NavUP must meet specific quality requirements such as:
				
				\begin{enumerate}
				\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}}}
				\item Performance - the system must handle a possbility of over 50000 users simultaneously and still perform important functionality without failure
				\item Reliability - the sytem should perform its functionality reliably, most importantly the navigational requirements.
				\item Usability - the system should be easy to use while sporting an aesthetic and ergonomic interface.
				\item Integrability - the sustem should allow for additional features and modules to be added easily.
				\end{enumerate}
				
			\subsubsection{Integration Requirements}
				The NavUp system will be implemented simultaneously by all the students enrolled in COS 301, it is therefore imperative that the system complies blaa %more fluffling needed
			\subsubsection{Architecture Constraints}
				The clients ave specified the use of technologies such as GIS, UI/UX, Mobile Development, Wifi Networking, Real-time Data Analysis, Data Streaming and
				Persistence....
