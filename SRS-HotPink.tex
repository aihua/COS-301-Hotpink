\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the NavUP application,  a navigation application which is intended to assist students,  staff and the  public with navigating the University of Pretoria. Additionally it will outline and explain the complete plan for building the NavUP system.The explanations include the constraints for the system and how the system will interact with external applications. Ultimately this document is to be used for client approval such that the system may be implemented.

	\subsection{Scope}

		The NavUP mobile application makes use of the Wi-Fi on campus in order to assist the user in finding the route to their destination from their current location or from a location which is on the University of Pretoria facilities this includes but is not limited to lecture halls,  food courts,  ablution facilities or possibly even sport or faculty houses. 
		\\
		The NavUP mobile application will use the users GPS location,  on their smart devices,  in conjunction with all the Wi-Fi routers on campus in order to determine the best route from their starting location. As a result the users require Wi-Fi enabled devices and login credentials to the Universities Wi-Fi network.The system will not be able to navigate a user from a location which is 			not within the range of the campus Wi-Fi.
		\\
 		Further more the  NavUP system also includes best route capabilities,  optimal routes for users with disabilities,  status of the number of people currently on campus based on the number of devices currently connected to the Wi-Fi network, points of interest,  activities and events that are happening on campus. It will also track the activity of the user e.g. The number of steps 				taken and reward the user based on the goals  they have achieved.

	\subsection{Overview}
		These are the chapters that follow; The Overall description chapter which describes the overall system,  the modules and the interfaces that exist within the system,  the system functions,  the charecteristics of the users of the system and the system constraints. The Specific Requirements chapter is intended for developers and contains the external interface requirements,  			functional requirements,  performance capabilities of the system as well as the design constraints and quality related requirements.

\newpage
\section{Overall Description}
	\subsection{Product Perspective}
	Similar to existing navigation applications such as: Google Maps,  Apple Maps and Waze,  NavUP is a standalone mobile application that acts as a campus navigation system which will be open for all UP students,  staff and guests to use. It encompasses all technologies,  which will be required for the necessary functionality as described in the product functions section. 
	\\
	\par
The application will be implented using the relevant,   already existing hardware,   software interfaces,  OS interfaces and technologies such as,  Wi-Fi,  Cellular Data and GPS. Implementation of the hardware interfaces will require the  existing software interfaces/OS interfaces to access data from the hardware interfaces relating to the main functionality of the NavUP application. 
	\\
	\par
The application will use communication interfaces to determine traffic and the best routes to follow,  these communication interfaces will work through the required hardware interfaces. The main operations of the application will be accessed through the user interface,  which will utilize underlying  technologies. These operations include: navigating to a class,   providing direction (showing where to go), displaying destination information( describing where and what it is you're going to). The DBMS will have to be manually maintained with location and event data or interfaced with an existing DBMS / DSS that the university already has. 

	\subsection{Product Functions}
	The NavUP mobile application will support a variety of functions namely; navigation,  providing information,  allowing for users to decide on different routes,  achieving goals and personalisation capabilities.
	\\

	The navigation functionality will consist of locating the user and then navigating them to their required location. They will be provided with searching capabilities in order to obtain their required location. Users will then be able to save their destination for future use.
	\\

	Information will be provided to users when they are near points of interest. This information will consist of historical and general information regarding venues and/or landmarks. Information regarding cultural and sporting events that relate to the user will also be shown when appropriate.
	\\

	Different routes will be provided based on the users needs. Such routes will include the fastest path from one location to the next. This path will be determined based on the amount of pedestrian traffic. Another route will be provided for users with special needs in order to allow them to reach their destination using the most user friendly path for their disability.
	\\

	Weekly goals will be provided to motivate users to attend all their lectures during the week,  explore the campus and be more informed about it as well as to increase the amount of steps they take this being beneficial to their overall wellbeing.

	\subsection{User Characteristics}
	There are three main categories of individuals that will make use of the application namely administrators,  general users and information providers.
	\\


	The administrators will ensure that the software works as intended and will be in charge of maintaining and upgrading the application. These users will need to understand how the system works as well as have programming knowledge in order to work on the software.
	\\

	The general users of the system will consist of students,  lecturers,  guests and university employees. They will only make use of the mobile application. This means that they will not require any knowledge of how the software is implemented however,  they will need to have knowledge regarding how to use a smart device. These users will mainly use the application for navigational purposes.
	\\

	The information providers role will be to inform administrators regarding events taking place at the university as well as to provide information regarding different buildings and landmarks within the university. They will not necessarily make use of the mobile application and will therefore only require knowledge regarding the university itself.

	\subsection{Constraints}
	The following are restrictions related to the application:
		\begin{enumerate}
				\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}}}
				\item Security  - The users personal information and current location should not be accessible to the public.
				\item Accuracy - The users location should be found whether the user is indoors or not. The location of the user should also be found in terms of which floor they are on in the building.
				\item Performance - The system should be able to handle a large amount of users making use of the software at the same time.
				\item Reliability - The application should still operate when one or more data access points are no longer available.
				\item Accessibility - The application should be easily accessible to everyone that requires it.
				\item Usability - The applications interface should be easy to use and understand.
				\item Size - The application should not require too much memory in order to operate.
				\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	Since the NavUP system is being created for mobile devices,  it is assumed that all those who require the application,  will have access to a mobile device. It is then assumed that these devices will have the required capabilities necessary to run the application. Such dependencies include built in WiFi,  GPS and cellular connectivity as well as the required data/airtime(in the event that they are not connected to the University's Wi-Fi).
\\
\par
Assumed users will be registered students of the University of Pretoria thereby having access to their modules and class data for navigating when required with minimal input from the user, this depends on access to students data for the DBMS, staff navigating to their work stations , guests wanting to navigate to a location which they only know by name.
\\
\par
In terms of the usability of the application,  it is assumed that users will have knowledge regarding how to use mobile devices and applications on such devices such as the downloading and installation of applications to a smart device.
\\
\par
The assumption relating to accuracy includes the belief that the application will be up to date with the latest information in terms of venues,  landmarks and events. This assumes that there will always be someone maintaining and updating the applications data,  or a DBMS that is interfaced with the university DBMS.  
\\
\par
An assumption in terms of the systems performance includes the idea that it will still be able to function when a large amount of users are making use of the application at the same time. This depends on server capacity as well as solid code structures that are efficient as well as secure.

	\subsection{Quality Requirements}
				A system of the complexity and scale of NavUP must meet specific quality requirements such as:
				
				\begin{enumerate}
				\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}}}
				\item Performance - the system must handle a possibility of over 50000 users simultaneously and still perform the core functionality without failure.
				\item Reliability - the sytem should perform its functionality reliably,  most importantly the navigational requirements.
				\item Usability - the system should be easy to use while sporting an aesthetic and ergonomic interface.
				\item Integrability - the system should allow for additional features and modules to be added easily.
				\end{enumerate}
				

			\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}
				From the typical user's perspective,  approximately 60000 students and staff,  the NavUP system will largely be focused on mobile devices such as Android or iOS smartphones.
				These devices,  will make use of location services and internet capabilities to send and recieve data to and from access channels and servers using mobile data, 
				Wi-Fi signals,  crowdsourcing and geolocation systems such as GPS and GIS. The campus Wi-Fi network will be the main form of system access as the signal
				strength covers most of the large area the University spans,  and will help location accuracy indoors where the mobile devices may struggle to find decent mobile
				and location based signals.

			
			\subsection{Integration Requirements}
				The NavUP system will be implemented simultaneously by all the students enrolled in COS 301,  it is therefore imperative that the system complies to a low coupling and high cohesion standard.
			\subsection{Architecture Constraints}
				The clients ave specified the use of technologies such as GIS,  UI/UX,  Mobile Development (Android/iOS),   Real-time Data Analysis,  Data Streaming and
				Persistence,  and a large focus on the use of Wi-Fi Networking to boost the system's accuracy. A module that supplies targeted delivery of information was also requested hence an intelligent program is also required.
				
			\subsection{User Interface}
				The user interface is likely to be used by students and staff alike,  and many visitors to the campus,  the interface therefore should be friendly and easy to use for all ages. The interface should include functionality for users to login and create personal profiles
				so that they can use the rewards system and access other functionality. There should also be different interface for administrative users who must be able to create point of interest and update activities and update and capture location data.
