# COS-301-Hotpink
## Synopsis
For this project we have created the requirements necessary for the NavUP system. The applications purpose is to help navigate employees, students and visitors around the University of Pretoria. Additional functionality will include determining the best route for the given user, providing information regarding venues, sporting and cultural events and allowing users to obtain weekly goals.
## Motivation
Every year there is an influx of new students, employees and visitors going to the university. Since the campus is large it is often difficult to find ones way around the university. The NavUP application aims to solve this problem by guiding individuals to their required location.
